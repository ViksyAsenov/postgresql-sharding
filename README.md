## Introduction

Sharding is a database architecture pattern related to horizontal partitioning â€” the practice of separating one table's rows into multiple tables, known as shards, which can be distributed across multiple databases.

## Prerequisites

- Docker Compose
- Node.js

## Setup

### Environment Configuration

1 . Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project with the following content:

    POSTGRES_PASSWORD=password-for-the-postgresql-instances
    MAIN_DB_PORT=port-to-map-the-main-db
    SHARD1_PORT=port-to-map-shard1
    SHARD2_PORT=port-to-map-shard2
    SHARD3_PORT=port-to-map-shard3

### Docker Setup

1 . Clone the repository:

    git clone https://github.com/ViksyAsenov/postgresql-sharding
    cd postgresql-sharding

2 . Build and start the Docker containers:

    docker compose --env-file .env -f docker-compose.yaml up -d

## Sharding Logic

The sharding logic is to separate the users based on their age:

- Users from 0-30 are put in the first shard
- Users from 30-60 are put in the second shard
- Users from 60-123 are put in the third shard

## Testing

A simple JavaScript test script is provided to verify the sharding implementation.

1 . Install dependencies:

    npm install

2 . Run the test script:

    npm test
